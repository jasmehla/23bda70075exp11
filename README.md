Title: Develop Microservice-Based Backend Module



Experiment Details This experiment focuses on building a microservice-based backend system using Python (Flask). Two independent services were created:



Customer Service



API to fetch customer details along with their orders

Communicates with Order Service using REST API

Order Service



API to fetch and update order status

Stores order data in-memory

Both customer and order data are stored using in-memory variables.



Services Overview



Customer Service

Fetches customer details

Calls Order Service to retrieve order data

Order Service



Provides order details for a user

Supports updating order status

Deployment (Render)



Customer Service https://exp11-customer-service.onrender.com



Order Service https://exp11-order-service.onrender.com



Final API (Microservice Communication) https://exp11-customer-service.onrender.com/customers/101/orders



This API returns:



Customer details

Order details (from Order Service)

How It Works



A request is sent to Customer Service

Customer Service processes the request

It calls Order Service via HTTP request

Order Service returns order data

Customer Service combines both responses

Final result is returned to the user

Testing



APIs were tested using Postman



Verified:



Customer Service endpoints

Order Service endpoints

Inter-service communication

Learning Outcomes



Understood microservices architecture

Learned to build REST APIs using Flask

Implemented communication between services using HTTP requests

Gained hands-on experience with Postman for API testing

Learned deployment of services on Render

Understood real-world service integration using deployed URLs

Conclusion



This experiment demonstrates how microservices can be developed, deployed independently, and integrated using REST APIs. It provides a basic understanding of real-world backend architecture.
